## Abstract (excerpt)
>  Economic theory suggests that energy subsidies can lead to excessive consumption and envi- ronmental degradation. However, the precise impact of energy subsidies is not well understood. We analyze a large energy subsidy: the California Alternate Rates for Energy (CARE). CARE provides a price reduction for low-income consumers of natural gas and electricity. Using a natu- ral field experiment, we estimate the price elasticity of demand for natural gas to be about -0.35 for CARE customers. An economic model of this subsidy yields three results. First, the natural gas subsidy appears to reduce welfare. Second, the economic impact of various policies, such as cap-and-trade, depends on whether prices for various customers move closer to the marginal social cost. Third, benefits to CARE custome

       Energy is subsidized in many countries around the world. Global energy subsidies were pro-
       jected to be $5 trillion after tax in 2015 (roughly 7% of worldwide GDP) (Coady et al., 2019).
       Motivations for using energy subsidies include reducing inequality, lifting households out of fuel
       poverty, and gaining political support. Economic theory suggests that these subsidies distort
       market prices, leading to excessive energy consumption and environmental degradation.
           Several government and academic studies have attempted to quantify the economic and en-
       vironmental impacts of energy subsidies (Aldy, 2013; Davis, 2014; International Energy Agency,
       2014; Coady et al., 2015; Parry et al., 2014; United Nations Environment Program, 2008). These
       studies suggest that the environmental consequences of energy subsidies could be significant. For
       example, Clements et al. (2013) and Coady et al. (2019) suggest that eliminating energy subsi-
       dies could reduce worldwide annual carbon dioxide (CO2 ) emissions by about 20-30% and reduce
       fossil fuel air pollution deaths by 46 percent.
           In general, these studies do not rely on clean causal econometric models for price elasticities
       because such estimates do not exist for the subsidized population under investigation. We intro-
       duce a novel approach for deriving and identifying natural gas price elasticity estimates using a
       large natural field experiment in California. We then use this estimate to assess the economic
       and environmental impacts of the price subsidy, and estimate the conditions under which price
       subsidies lead to a reduction in welfare.
           We analyze a subsidy that is a marginal energy price reduction for low-income customers
       in California. It is called the California Alternate Rates for Energy (CARE) program, which
       provides a 20% reduction in the marginal price of natural gas and a 30-35% reduction in the
       marginal price of electricity for low-income customers throughout the state (California Public
       Utilities Commission, 2016). In 2015, approximately 4.85 million households qualified for this
       program in California, and approximately 1.5 million households qualified in the Los Angeles
       region served by Southern California Gas (SoCalGas).
           Our field experiment had two primary objectives. First, we wanted to obtain a causal estimate
       of the price elasticity of demand for natural gas. There are relatively few good estimates of the
       price elasticity of gas demand that account for endogeneity in pricing. There is a large historical
       literature in applied econometrics on energy demand (e.g., Houthakker and Taylor, 1970). Some
       of the earlier work analyzed cross-sectional or panel data (Krichene, 2002; Alberini et al., 2011).
       Some used panel studies with instrumental variables (IV) (Davis and Muehlegger, 2010; Hausman
       and Kellogg, 2015). More recent work by Auffhammer and Rubin (2018) uses a supply-shifting
       IV approach to estimate natural gas elasticities across California. The authors provide point
       estimates for natural gas price elasticities of 0.24 for CARE consumers and 0.14 for the rest
       of the population who are not on CARE. We use the latter elasticity for a part of our welfare
       estimates.1 Overall, this literature suggests a wide price elasticity of natural gas demand between
       -0.1 and -0.6. The dearth of causal studies estimating the price elasticity of demand for natural
   1
     Their elasticity estimates are different from ours in that they measure their CARE elasticity after people enroll onto CARE
and spend several years on the pricing subsidy. We are primarily interested in the quantity response that results from a 20% price
decrease when people sign up for CARE.



                                                                1
       gas is surprising given that natural gas is: (i) currently used by around half of U.S. residential
       consumers to heat their home (U.S. Energy Information Administration, 2016); and (ii) the fuel
       that will probably be used more in the future as it is a relatively clean fossil fuel with desirable
       cost characteristics (Levine et al., 2014).
           Second, we wanted to understand the welfare impacts and equity-tradeoffs associated with the
       price subsidy. This included the welfare impacts of introducing the subsidy, and the impacts of
       modifying the price subsidy in a number of ways that might increase economic welfare. Examples
       include moving prices toward the marginal social cost (MSC), introducing a cap-and-trade or tax
       regime, and implementing a voucher program for low-income households. To address equity, we
       examine the implied weight that policy makers put on the subsidy in order for costs of the subsidy
       to just equal benefits.2
           To help achieve these objectives, we implemented a natural field experiment with over 70,000
       households over two years with SoCalGas, resulting in around one million monthly energy use
       observations. We randomized a fraction of the customers who were potentially eligible to be on
       the price subsidy to receive a letter. The letter noted their eligibility and encouraged them to
       sign up for the CARE price subsidy. It is important to note that our encouragement treatment
       is the business-as-usual treatment, so the selection we have into the price subsidy is as natural
       as one could achieve. The control group did not receive the encouragement letters although they
       were free to enroll if they wanted to by finding out about the program online or through other
       means. Our randomized design allowed us to estimate a local average treatment effect (LATE)
       of enrolling onto the CARE price subsidy on gas consumption. Once we estimate the change in
       quantity demanded from the price subsidy, we then calculate the impact of the price subsidy on
       economic welfare for those who received the subsidy and society more generally.
           The field experiment had three main results. First, our encouragement design worked well,
       which allowed us to estimate gas price elasticities. Our first-stage letters resulted in an 8 to
       10 percentage point increase in the number of people who enrolled onto CARE over the non-
       encouraged control group. Using this randomized first-stage, we estimated the LATE of the
       price subsidy on consumption. Over the course of 12 to 18 months, the 20% price subsidy led
       to around an 8.5% increase in natural gas demand. We find price elasticity estimates between
       -0.29 and -0.35 for our CARE sample over 12 to 18 months, and about -0.35 for a representative
       CARE customer. Second, the poorer the household, the more price elastic they are. Third, we
       find no causal evidence of a difference in the elasticity of those already randomized in to a gas
       conservation program and those not in the conservation program. The conservation program
       is the Opower (Oracle) Home Energy Report (HER), which provides social information on how
       customers compare to their neighbors in gas use and provides other information on conservation
       (Allcott, 2011b; Allcott, 2015). This evidence demonstrates that nudges, such as social norms,
       may not change the consumerâ€™s price elasticity of demand.
           Using these findings, we construct a structural model that allows us to estimate the change
       in total economic welfare resulting from this price subsidy. The model includes a regulated en-

       ergy sector with two prices: one for CARE customers and one for non-CARE customers. Our
       model provides a simple way of recovering the counterfactual price before CARE is introduced.
       The model may have general applicability for regulated entities that offer low-income customers
       subsidized prices, as is often the case with gas, electricity, water, telecommunications, and trans-
       portation.
           There are three main results associated with the welfare model. First, the overall impact of
       the subsidy appears to reduce economic welfare. This result is not obvious because the subsidy
       involves a good where there is a significant externality and prices are set above the marginal
       private cost (MPC). In the base case, there is a net increase in energy use and emissions that
       results in an estimated total welfare loss of about $4.8 million. The consumer surplus gain for
       CARE customers is about $76 million, due to the price reduction; but the consumer surplus loss
       for non-CARE customers is about $87 million, due to the price increase.
           We calculate the optimal subsidy for California is zero. There is no level of the price subsidy
       that would lead to increases in total welfare. We also consider the economic impact of removing
       the natural gas subsidy instead of supporting current energy efficiency investments for natural
       gas in California. We find that removing the subsidy could be a cost-effective way of reducing
       CO2 emissions (saving about $130 per ton reduced), and is much more cost-effective than some
       energy efficiency investments in California. Furthermore, the CO2 emissions reduced by removing
       the subsidy would be comparable in quantity to the current CO2 emissions reduced from energy
       efficiency investments in California.
           Second, the impact of CARE on welfare depends on whether particular policy experiments
       move the prices customers face closer to the marginal social cost. Following convention, the
       marginal social cost is defined to be equal to the marginal private cost plus the marginal external
       cost. If prices are set equal the marginal social cost, we measure the increase in efficiency.
           In some cases, the efficiency impacts of a policy intervention can differ for CARE and non-
       CARE customers. For example, introducing a CO2 allowance price of $13/ton (similar to the
       California price during the period of study) on top of existing prices makes the new gas price
       closer to the MSC for CARE customers, but further away for non-CARE customers. The resulting
       net loss in social welfare is about $7.4 million. Furthermore, any cap-and-trade scheme will not
