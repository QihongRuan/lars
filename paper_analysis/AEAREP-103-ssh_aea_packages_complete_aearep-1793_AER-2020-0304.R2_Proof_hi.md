## Abstract (excerpt)
>  We study two-player games where one-sided asymmetric information can lead to either adverse or advantageous selection. We contrast behavior in these games with settings where both players are uninformed. We find stark differences, suggesting that subjects do account for endogenous selection effects. Removing strategic uncer- tainty increases the fraction of subjects who account for selection. Subjects respond more to adverse than advantageous selection. Using additional treatments where we vary payoff feedback, we connect this difference to learning. We also observe a significant fraction of subjects who appear to understand selection effects but do not apply that knowledge. JEL: C91, C92, D72, D81, D82.

Motivation: Asymmetric information is central to many economic and social interac-
tions. When individuals are asymmetrically informed, it can be rational for the less in-
formed individual to be suspicious of the motives of someone who is better-informed. For
instance, Akerlof (1970) illustrates how buyers should be pessimistic about the quality
of products being sold given that better informed sellers are willing to sell those objects.
Rothschild and Stiglitz (1976) argue that insurance providers should set premiums an-
ticipating that those who privately know that they have a higher likelihood of claiming
the insurance also have a greater incentive to buy it. Similarly, the “No-Trade Theorem”
(Milgrom and Stokey, 1982) articulates how bettors engaged in speculative trading should
draw inferences based on the motive that others have for taking opposing bets.
    Across these settings, we see a common theme of adverse selection. From the perspec-
tive of each individual, the payoff of an available option—be it buying used cars, selling
insurance, or taking a bet—is determined both by nature and the endogenously chosen
actions of other parties. But selection is not always adverse; when preferences are aligned,
then the selection may be advantageous. For instance, if potential insurees are better-
informed about their risk preferences, those who have a higher demand for insurance may
be the risk-averse individuals who are “good risks” for an insurer (De Meza and Webb,
2001; Fang, Keane, and Silverman, 2008). In elections where voters share common prefer-
ences, some voters may be willing to abstain on ballot propositions to let better-informed
voters cast the decisive votes, and thereby benefit from the selection of outcomes generated
by the actions of others (Feddersen and Pesendorfer, 1996).
    We study how well people account for adverse and advantageous selection. How do
people behave when they know that they are asymmetrically informed? Is the impact of
asymmetric information uniform across adverse and advantageous selection or do people
account for selection more in some settings than in others?

Main Design and Findings: The core of our design is a simple two-player game de-
scribed in Section 2: Alice and Bob jointly choose between a safe and risky option. The
safe option yields identical payoffs for each party. The risky option is a lottery with a high
payoff that exceeds that of the safe option and a low payoff below it. In positively correlated
rounds, Alice and Bob obtain identical payoffs from the risky option and so either both
gain or lose from the risky option being chosen. Preferences here are perfectly aligned. In
negatively correlated rounds, Alice and Bob have misaligned interests: relative to the safe
option, one of them gains from the risky option while the other loses. Ex ante, each is

               equally likely to be the winner. In both positively and negatively correlated rounds, players
               vote simultaneously between the safe and risky option, and the risky option is selected if
               and only if both players vote for it. Importantly, one player—say Alice—privately observes
               the realized payoffs of the risky option whereas the other player is only told whether it is
               positively or negatively correlated. That the pair is asymmetrically informed is common
               knowledge between them.
                   What do standard theories of selection predict in this setting? If players are selfish
               and play weakly undominated strategies, the informed player (Alice) votes for the risky
               option if and only if it benefits her. Anticipating this choice, Bob always votes for the
               risky option if payoffs are positively correlated because the risky option is then selected
               advantageously: if he votes for it, then it is selected only when Alice votes for it as well,
               which means that it must benefit her and therefore him too. By contrast, if payoffs are
               negatively correlated, then Bob always votes for the safe option because he anticipates
               that the risky option is selected adversely: Alice votes for the risky option only when she
               gains from it, which means he must lose from it. These behavioral predictions for the
               two asymmetric information games do not require the fixed-point logic of equilibrium but
               instead follow from two rounds of elimination of weakly dominated strategies.
                   This reasoning suggests a test of whether subjects account for selection: when they
               are in the role of the uninformed player (Bob), are they more likely to choose the risky
               option when payoffs are positively correlated than when they are negatively correlated?
               We show in Table 3 that the answer is yes. We consider two payoff variations for each
               correlation condition: one where the safe option yields a low payoff (below the expected
               value of the risky option) and one where it yields a high payoff (above the expected value
               of the risky option).1 When the safe option has a low value, shifting the payoffs from
               negative to positive correlation raises the fraction choosing the risky option from 48% to
               86%; when the safe option has a high value, the corresponding numbers are 1% and 33%.
               Thus, behavior shifts in the direction predicted by theories of asymmetric information.
               Moreover, about 20% of subjects make every choice in a way that is fully consistent with
               the predictions of adverse and advantageous selection.
                   We control for non-informational confounds by comparing the above behavior with
               games where both players learn the correlation structure but are symmetrically uninformed
               about the realized payoffs.2 In this game, shifting from negative to positive correlation

                   One potential confound is aversion to inequality: the negatively-correlated risky option is ex ante fair
               but ex post unequal whereas the positively-correlated risky option is both ex ante and ex post equal. If
               subjects are averse to ex post inequality, there is a confounding rationale for a subject to choose the safe
               option when payoffs are negatively correlated but not when payoffs are positively correlated.


                                                                    2

raises the fraction voting for the risky option from 78% to 88% with a low payoff for the
safe option, and from 4% to 8% with a high payoff for the safe option. Thus, we see shifts
in the same direction, but with a much smaller magnitude. Comparing the magnitude of
these effects with those of the asymmetric information games suggests that a significant
fraction of subjects do account for asymmetric information.
    However, we also find that a significant proportion of subjects fail to account for se-
lection, at least in some cases. Studying positive and negative correlation in a unified
framework allows us to compare how subjects respond to adverse versus advantageous
selection. We see that subjects respond more to adverse selection. When payoffs are neg-
atively correlated, over half of the subjects consistently choose the safe option but when
payoffs are positively correlated, less than a third of the subjects consistently choose the
risky option. We investigate what accounts for this gap and, more generally, why behav-
ior departs from the theoretical predictions of asymmetric information. To this end, we
investigate the role of strategic uncertainty, difficulties of contingent reasoning, and a lack
of payoff feedback about counterfactuals.

Strategic Uncertainty and Contingent Reasoning: Although behavior in our game
is pinned down by eliminating two rounds of weakly dominated strategies when players
are selfish, subjects may potentially face strategic uncertainty about the preferences and
behavior of others. To assess the role of strategic uncertainty, we conduct a second treat-
ment, described in Section 5, in which subjects are never paired with each other and are
instead paired with computerized “robot” players whose strategies are known ahead of
time. In the main asymmetric information game, these robot players observe the realized
payoff and chooses the risky option if and only if it generates a higher (virtual) payoff for
the robot than the safe option; human players never observe the realized payoff but know
its correlation.
    Removing strategic uncertainty significantly increases the degree to which subjects
account for selection. Indeed, in this second treatment, when the safe option has a low
value and subjects face a negatively correlated risky option, 77% of our subjects correctly
choose the safe option, which is significantly higher than in the first treatment (52%).
Similarly, when the safe option has a high value and subjects face a positively correlated
risky option, the fraction of subjects who correctly choose the risky option is 46%, which
