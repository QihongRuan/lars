The Eects of Parental and Sibling
Incarceration: Evidence from Ohio
Samuel Norris, Matthew Pecenco & Jerey Weaverâˆ—
March 9, 2021

Abstract
Every year, millions of Americans experience the incarceration of a family member. Using 30 years of administrative data from Ohio and exploiting diering
incarceration propensities of randomly assigned judges, this paper provides the
rst quasi-experimental estimates of the eects of parental and sibling incarceration in the US. Parental incarceration has benecial eects on some important
outcomes for children, reducing their likelihood of incarceration by 4.9 percentage points and improving their adult neighborhood quality. While estimates
on academic performance and teen parenthood are imprecise, we reject large
positive or negative eects. Sibling incarceration leads to similar reductions in
criminal activity.

The United States has the highest rate of incarceration in the developed world, directly affecting millions of prisoners annually. Beyond prisoners, an even larger number of family and
community members are indirectly aected by incarceration. Advocates and academics have
primarily argued that the incarceration of a parent or sibling will have negative eects on
children as a result of the removal of social and economic support (Annie E Casey Foundation, 2016; Donohue, 2009). Due to the larger pool of people aected, these spillover eects of
incarceration could be even more important than the direct eects on the incarcerated.
On the other hand, there are several reasons why incarceration might have benecial
family spillovers.

Some children may be moved to more stable home environments when

a parent is incarcerated, especially if the parent is incarcerated for crimes that adversely
aect their children such as abuse.

Witnessing incarceration rst-hand could also increase

the salience of punishment and thus deter a child from future criminal activity. In the case
of siblings, incarceration may remove a criminogenic peer inuence.

The eect of familial

incarceration will vary from case to case: for some individuals, the negative mechanisms will
dominate, while the positive mechanisms will dominate for others. As a result, the net spillover
eect of incarceration is theoretically ambiguous, depending on the proportion of individuals
experiencing either positive or negative consequences.
Empirical evidence on the long-term spillover eects of incarceration in the United States
has been largely correlational, such as comparisons between children with and without incarcerated parents. Most of these studies nd negative eects of parental incarceration on outcomes
such as antisocial behavior, drug use, academic achievement, and criminality (e.g.

Murray,

Farrington and Sekol (2012), Roettger et al. (2011), Hagan and Foster (2012)).

However,

if children with incarcerated parents come from relatively disadvantaged households, these
estimates do not have causal interpretations and will be biased towards nding a negative
impact.

This lack of causal evidence is largely due to stringent data requirements. Causal estimates
require exogenous variation in incarceration, the ability to link family members to defendants,
and outcome data for the family members.

For long-term outcomes, the data must span

enough time to observe adult outcomes for those aected by family incarceration. To overcome

Other studies use panel data to estimate the eect of parental incarceration on short-run academic outcomes
around the time of parental incarceration. These papers nd minimal (Cho, 2009b) or even benecial eects
(Cho, 2009a; Billings, 2017) of parental incarceration.
