Placebo Tests of Inner/Outer Research Design

As a falsification test of our main results, we calculate a false exposure measure by randomly
drawing an at-risk tenure’s inner ring (0.1 miles) exposure to both flips and investor neighbors
conditional on their actual outer ring exposure. For example, if an at-risk tenure is exposed to
3 flips within 0.5 miles, we randomly draw how many of these are within 0.1 miles according
the actual distribution of inner/outer exposure in the data. We then estimate comparable
hazard regressions using this false-exposure data set.
In Figure A1, we report the distribution of the inner hazard effect from 100 draws of
the false-exposure data set for each type of exposure. The placebo effect is centered tightly
around zero. The results from actual data produces an estimate that is clearly to the right of
the false exposure for both types of investing activity, indicating that homes actually exposed
to very nearby investing activity are significantly more likely to become investors themselves.
While this cannot identify the actual mechanisms at work–information sharing, word-ofmouth influence, etc.–the results of the placebo test are strong evidence of causal effects
occurring within the narrow ring, city-block level of geography that induces homeowners to
engage in investing activity.

Figure A1: Placebo Test of Contagion Mechanism: Full Data Sample with Placebo Exposure.

NOTES: The figure displays the distribution of the hazard estimator for the false (placebo) exposure to investment activity.
The distribution comes from 100 random draws of placebo inner ring (0.1 mi.) exposures over the full data set. The dashed
vertical line is the estimate from the full data sample (Table ??).

Robustness of Main Results

Table B1 illustrates the robustness of the results from the model of Table ?? to alternate
clustering methods to account for spatial and temporal correlation in the model’s error structure.
Table B2 illustrates that the baseline results in Table ?? with zip code-level fixed effects
are robust to census tract-level fixed effects.
Table B3 presents a number of additional robustness checks related to sample selection.
(Column 0 gives the baseline results from Table ?? above.) Section ?? described how we
inferred whether the purchaser of the home was at-risk (i.e. used the home as their primary
residence)1 and whether an individual became an investor. We recognize the potential measurement error the inference on name matching entails, so we examine the sensitivity of the
baseline results to our ability to identify at-risk tenures and flag investors in the data. Since
this set of robustness checks changes the sample, we report the baseline hazard for the sample
of at-risk individuals included in each alternative. All regressions use our research design,
although for brevity we only report estimates of the innermost rings.
The first two columns consider the name matching algorithm used to infer investors.
Column 1 uses only detailed names, i.e. those with middle names/initials and/or spouses
listed, since these are less likely to be duplicated. The effect size as measured by hazard ratio
is slightly smaller for flips, but larger for investor neighbors. Column 2 drops any names that
are combinations of common names, defined as both first and last being in the top 20 percent
of names observed in the data. Recall that we have already excluded any name with more
than 42 properties attached, which removed common names like John Smith and Jose Lopez.
This is an additional flag for a name like Michael Thompson, where Michael and Thompson

Note that we also must observe the investor’s primary residence to include this investor in the spatial
match of the investor neighbor righthand-side variable. These sample selection checks refer to inclusion of
the at-risk tenures (lefthand-side variable).

NOTES: The first two columns of the table are the baseline results from Table 5. The table illustrates that the baseline results
are robust to the inclusion of finer geographic fixed effects, namely at the census tract level (for census tracts with very few
sales, representing less than 5% of overall transactions, we aggregate to the zip code level). Standard errors in parentheses are
clustered at the property tenure level. Coefficients have been multiplied by 10,000 for readability.

are common, but Michael Thompson was not so common as to already be removed.2 This
drops an additional 2 million monthly observations, with little effect on the results.
Columns 3 and 4 consider the geographic proximity of the investors’ purchasing areas
under the suspicion that a wide area may indicate two different individuals with the same
(relatively uncommon) name. Column 3 drops any investor whose purchases are no closer
than 50 miles, and column 4 drops anyone who purchases a property more than 50 miles from
his/her other purchases. The loss of observations is small, indicating this is of low incidence,
and the effect sizes are quite similar.
Our research design revolves around the “primary residence,” which assumes the individual lives in the property we flag as such. The data contain two other sources of information
(although also imperfect) on whether the property was actually owner-occupied. First, the
HMDA data includes a flag for whether the loan application was for an owner-occupied
home. Second, the assessor data match includes information on the owner’s home mailing
address; matching this to the property address gives another indicator for whether the home
is considered owner-occupied.3 Column 5 limits to individuals in properties flagged as owneroccupied. The results show that limiting our analysis to these tenures that meet these more
stringent definition of an at-risk homeowner produces very similar results; to the extent we
have misidentified primary residence, it does not appear to bias our results.
Overall, while we readily acknowledge the possibility of measurement error in our designation of investors, there is no evidence that it is driving our results. It would take a
remarkable pattern of micro-level sorting by name similarity to randomly generate the patterns we observe.

The commonality of first (and last) names was calculated ignoring the presence of middle names/initials
or spouse names.
3
Note that because the assessor data is overwritten each year by Dataquick, it reflects information from
2011. As a result, this measure or owner-occupancy can only be used for tenures that persist into the 2011
assessment year, limiting the number of observations for which this flag is useful primarily to those late in
the sample.
