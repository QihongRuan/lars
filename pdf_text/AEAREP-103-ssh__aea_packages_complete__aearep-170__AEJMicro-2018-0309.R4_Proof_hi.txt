Inducing Cooperation through Weighted Voting and Veto
Power
By Antonin Macé and Rafael Treibich∗
We study the design of voting rules for committees representing heterogeneous groups (countries, states, districts) when cooperation among groups is voluntary. While efficiency recommends
weighting groups proportionally to their stakes, we show that accounting for participation constraints entails overweighting some
groups, those for which the incentive to cooperate is the lowest.
When collective decisions are not enforceable, cooperation induces
more stringent constraints that may require granting veto power
to certain groups. In the benchmark case where groups differ
only in their population size (i.e, the apportionment problem), the
model provides a rationale for setting a minimum representation
for smaller groups.
In 1787, when the founding fathers met in Philadelphia to discuss the creation
of a new constitution, the most contentious issue revolved around the composition of the future legislature. Larger states, led by Virginia, argued in favor of
a bicameral legislature, under which states would receive a number of seats proportional to their population in both houses. Smaller states rejected the Virginia
Plan, proposing instead the creation of a single house, under which states would
receive an equal number of seats, independently of their population. The conflict
was so serious that smaller states threatened to leave the union if larger states
insisted on the idea of a purely proportional representation:
“The small ones would find some foreign ally of more honor and good faith,
who will take them by the hand and do them justice.”
Gunning Bedford Jr., representative for Delaware, 1787.
The issue was resolved by the so-called Connecticut Compromise, and the creation of a bicameral legislature, under which states received a weight proportional
to their population in the lower house (House of Representatives), but an equal

weight in the upper house (Senate). The resulting distribution of seats in the
Electoral College1 appears as a compromise between the principle of “one man,
one vote”, leading to efficient and democratic decision-making, and the principle
of “one state, one vote”, ensuring the voluntary participation of all states. As
illustrated in Figure 1, this distribution is such that the number of electors per
capita in each state decreases with the state’s population.

The tension between the efficiency of a multi-party institution and its acceptability by all parties is not limited to the episode of the Constitutional Convention.
In fact, such a tension is also inherently present for many international organizations and confederations, when a set of sovereign states voluntarily commits to
collectively decide on one or several policy areas. One prominent example is the
UN Security Council, in which the five permanent members can veto any resolution, thus benefiting from a disproportionate power. The veto power has often
been criticized for severely reducing the efficiency of the UN and taking away
much of its relevance on the international scene. However, when the Charter of
the UN was ratified in San Francisco in 1945, “the issue was made crystal clear by
the leaders of the Big Five: it was either the Charter with the veto or no Charter
at all” (Wilcox, 1945). In the UN, as in many international organizations, the
need to accommodate countries’ voluntary participation is further aggravated by
1 The Electoral College is a representative committee designed to elect the U.S. president. The number
of electors obtained by each state corresponds to the sum of its number of senators (2) and of its number
of representatives in the House. In most states, electors are appointed through a winner-takes-all system.
The numbers presented in the graph are valid for the elections of 2012, 2016 and 2020 (US Census
Bureau, 2010).

the lack of external enforcement, since sovereign countries cannot be forced to
respect the collective decision ex-post.
The importance of both ex-ante and ex-post participation constraints may vary
with the nature of collective decisions, sometimes leading to different voting rules
within the same organization. This is the case for example at the Council of the
European Union, one of the EU’s main decision-making bodies, where the most
sensitive decisions are taken at the unanimity, while other type of reforms are
taken at a double qualified majority.2 At the UN, the General Assembly - who
has a softer, more deliberative role than the Security Council - gives an equal
representation to all countries and makes decisions at a two third majority rule.
As these examples show, participation constraints play a critical role in shaping
collective decision rules. Although the agreed rules vary significantly across institutions, they all appear to depart from efficiency so as to ensure the voluntary
participation of all parties. In this article, we propose to study the design of
voting rules for committees representing heterogeneous groups (countries, states,
districts) when cooperation among groups is voluntary, and the enforceability of
collective decisions may not be guaranteed. When should the voting rule depart
from the efficient benchmark, and if so, which group should be overweighted?
When should some groups benefit from veto power? To address these questions,
we take a second-best approach to institutional design by looking for the most
efficient rules among those that are politically feasible.3
Our model features a fixed set of countries choosing whether to delegate some of
their competences to a supranational entity.4 The choice to transfer a competence
is made unanimously ex ante, before countries learn about their preferences over
future decisions.5 If cooperation is agreed upon, decisions are made collectively
according to a predetermined voting rule. If cooperation is rejected, countries
remain sovereign and make their own decisions.
Our core assumption is that the choice to delegate reflects a trade-off between
the efficiency gains from cooperation and a reduced control over decisions. Making collective decisions is profitable for many reasons: it generates coordination
2 Decisions regarding common foreign and security policy, citizenship (the granting of new rights to
EU citizens), EU membership, harmonisation of national legislation on indirect taxation, EU finances
(own resources, the multiannual financial framework), certain provisions in the field of justice and home
affairs (the European prosecutor, family law, operational police cooperation, etc.), the harmonization of
national legislation in the field of social security and social protection are taken at the unanimity. Other
(less sensitive) decisions are taken according to the following rule: a reform is adopted if approved by
55% of the Member States, representing at least 65% of the EU population. Additionally, a proposal
cannot be blocked by less than four Member States.
3 An alternative approach would be to explore which decision rules are likely to arise from a bargaining
phase among countries in the presence of such constraints. We provide a discussion of this perspective
in the Conclusion and in Appendix A.9.
4 For instance, the European Union has exclusive competence over customs unions, competition policy,
monetary policy (for countries in the Eurozone), common fisheries policy, and common commercial policy.
The EU also holds shared competence (Member States cannot exercise competence in areas where the EU
has done so) over various other domains, such as the internal market, agricultural policy, environmental
policy, and consumer protection. See Treaty of Lisbon (2007b).
5 The fact that all EU competences must be voluntarily transferred by its Member States is known
as the principle of conferral (Treaty of Lisbon, 2007a).
