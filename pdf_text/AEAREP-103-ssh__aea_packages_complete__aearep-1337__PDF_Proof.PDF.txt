Abstract
We study the optimal lockdown for a planner who controls the fatalities of COVID19 while minimizing the output costs of the lockdown. The policy prescribes a severe
lockdown beginning few weeks after the outbreak, covering almost 50% of the population
after a month, with a total duration shy of four months. The intensity of the optimal
lockdown depends on the gradient of the fatality rate with respect to the infected, and
the availability of antibody testing, which yields a welfare gain of 2% of GDP. We also
study test-tracing-quarantine, which we show to be complementary to lockdown.

We adopt a variation of the SIR epidemiology model of Kermack and McKendrick (1927)
to characterize the optimal policy response to the COVID19 outbreak under several scenarios.
The typical approach in the epidemiology literature is to study the dynamics of the pandemic,
for infected, deaths, and recovered, as functions of some exogenously chosen diffusion parameters,
which are in turn related to various policies, such as the partial lockdown of schools, businesses,
and other measures of diffusion mitigation, where the diffusion parameters are stratified by
individual covariates, see e.g. Ferguson et al. (2020). We use a simple version of these models
to analyze how to optimally balance the fatalities induced by the epidemic with the output
costs of the lockdown policy. Our model thus features a key tradeoff between lives saved
vs. forgone production. The novel aspect of our analysis is to explicitly formulate and solve
a control problem, where the diffusion parameter is affected by the lockdown, chosen to
maximize a social objective while taking into account the dynamics of the system.1 A reason
to write a planning problem directly is that, with social interactions there is an externality
to be corrected. As understood and analyzed in Eichenbaum, Rebelo and Trabandt (2020);
Farboodi, Jarosch and Shimer (2020) and Toxvaerd (2020), the voluntary social distance in
the absence of a government-imposed lockdown would not be socially optimal. We use global
methods because in our setup the interaction of the law of motion of the SIR model and the
lockdown policy makes the problem non-convex.2
By computing the optimal policy and the associated trajectories, we aim to gauge the
key elements that determine the intensity and duration of the lockdown. We solve the
problem under different scenarios, that include congestion effects in the health care system,
the effectiveness of the lockdown in reducing the diffusion of the virus, the possibility of
testing for antibodies, and the possibility to trace and quarantine infected agents.
We parametrize the model using a range of estimates about the COVID19 epidemic.

An optimal control problem based on a very similar epidemiological model can be found in Hansen and
Troy (2011), but the objective function and the feasible policies are different.

Using first order conditions to solve for the path of states, controls, and co-states, as well as transversality,
provides a necessary but not sufficient condition. That is why we use a discrete-time discrete-state finite
difference approach.

Since we recognize that several parameters are highly uncertain, we explore a range of values
concerning the severity of the congestion effects on the fatality rate, a range of valuations for
the cost of lost lives, and the possibility of testing and releasing the recovered agents from
lockdown.
In our baseline parameterization, conditional on a 1% fraction of infected agents at the
outbreak and no cure for the disease, the optimal policy prescribes a lockdown starting four
weeks after the outbreak, and covering 45% of the population after 8 weeks. The lockdown is
kept tight for about a full month, and is gradually withdrawn, covering 30% of the population
3 months after the initial outbreak. The output cost of the lockdown is high, equivalent to
losing 6% of one year’s GDP (or, equivalently, a permanent reduction of 0.3% of output).
The total welfare costs is more than four times bigger due to the cost of deaths (see Panel A
in Figure 1 and Table 1).
The intensity of the optimal lockdown depends critically on the gradient of the fatality
rate as a function of the infected. If we consider a constant fatality rate the intensity and
duration of the lockdown are significantly reduced and, in some cases, completely eliminated,
even though the welfare cost of the pandemic remains high. On the other hand, the value
of the statistical life we use in our benchmark case (40 times annual GDP per capita) is on
the low range of the estimates in the literature. Following Hall, Jones and Klenow (2020),
our benchmark value takes into account that the majority of the victims of the virus have a
below average life expectancy. A higher value of statistical life makes the abandonment of
the lockdown more gradual.
Our benchmark scenario assumes, as seems realistic following the outbreak, that there
is no antibody test that allows those that recover to be issued an immunity card and go
back to work. We also analyze the problem in a scenario with such a test, in which case the
optimal lockdown is longer, but overall it involves similar total number of lost working hours
(forgone GDP, see Figure 1 and Table 1). The most salient feature of the case where a test
is not available is that the lockdown ends up sooner and more abruptly. The dynamics of

the epidemiological model explain why this is optimal: as time goes by, the fraction of those
recovered increases, and thus the lockdown becomes less efficient to stop the transmission of
the virus by locking down a progressively larger fraction of those that do not transmit it. The
availability of an antibody test yields a large welfare gain, in the order of 2% of one year’s
GDP. A byproduct of the calculations is the benefit of the lockdown policy, measured as a
percentage permanent GDP flow of following the optimal policy vs the case of no lockdown
(see Table 1). Under our preferred values, the total welfare cost of the virus is equivalent to
a loss of 28% to 32% of one year’s GDP. From this loss, the part due to the forgone GDP is
between 6% and 8% of one year’s GDP.
We conclude with two extensions that are relevant for applications to an actual economy.
The first considers a setting where the planner’s controls include a trace-test-quarantine
(TTQ) instrument. The goal is to understand whether TTQ is a complement or a substitute
of the lockdown policy. Our findings show that there is a large overlap between the region
of the state space where the lockdown is used and the one where the TTQ is used. The
second extension takes a step towards realism by considering that one consequence of the
lockdown is to “buy time” and allow for better treatment technologies to be available. Such
technologies include, among others, antibody tests, more ICU capacity, test-tracing apps, and
eventually a vaccine. The expectation of improved instruments to deal with the epidemic
creates a dynamic complementarity: the incentives for lockdown are strengthened because,
by delaying the diffusion, the planner will face the problem with better instruments and thus
incur smaller losses. Such complementarities can be powerful: the prospect of a smart-tracing
technology may lead to an immediate lockdown in an economy where, absent such prospect,
there would be no lockdown at all.
Our simple analysis has limitations: the underlying model has no heterogeneity in fatality
rates nor in diffusion rates, the lockdown policy cannot be differentiated across agent’s type,
see Favero, Ichino and Rustichini (2020) for a seminal exploration of the idea of an age- and
industry- specific lockdown and Acemoglu et al. (2020) for an extension of our framework
