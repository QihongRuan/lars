The Abolition of Immigration Restrictions and the
Performance of Firms and Workers: Evidence from
Switzerland

Abstract
We study a reform that granted European cross-border workers free access to the Swiss
labor market and had a stronger effect on regions close to the border. The greater availability
of cross-border workers increased foreign employment substantially. Although many crossborder workers were highly educated, wages of highly educated natives increased. The reason
is a simultaneous increase in labor demand: the reform increased the size, productivity, and
innovation performance of skill-intensive incumbent firms and attracted new firms, creating
opportunities for natives to pursue managerial jobs. These effects are mainly driven by firms
that reported skill shortages before the reform.

written: Beerli and Peri (2018) and Ruffner and Siegenthaler (2017). The first paper analyzed the employment, wage, mobility and
occupational specialization effects of the labor market liberalization in Switzerland. The second studied the firm-level impact of the
same reform, establishing its effects on the employment of foreigners within firms and on size, productivity, innovation, location and
staffing decisions of firms. We are indebted to the editor and four referees for unusually helpful comments. We also thank the following
