Behavioral Constraints on the Design of Subgame-Perfect
Implementation Mechanisms
By Ernst Fehr and Michael Powell and Tom Wilkening*
We study subgame-perfect implementation (SPI) mechanisms that
have been proposed as a solution to incomplete contracting problems. We show that these mechanisms — which are based on offequilibrium arbitration clauses that impose large fines for lying and
the inappropriate use of arbitration — have severe behavioral constraints because the fines induce retaliation against legitimate uses
of arbitration. Incorporating reciprocity preferences into the theory explains the observed behavioral patterns and helps us develop
a new mechanism that is more robust and achieves high rates of
truth-telling and efficiency. Our results highlight the importance of
tailoring implementation mechanisms to the underlying behavioral
environment.

Incomplete contracts pervade economic and political life. Politicians in executive positions as well as bureaucrats in ministries and agencies act on the basis
of loose objectives, and the obligations of employees and managers in private organizations are often described in vague terms. Economists have explored the
implications of incomplete contracts by developing models that assume that key
payoff-relevant information is observable but not verifiable by a third-party enforcer.1 Such observable but non-verifiable information implies that third-party
enforcement of state-contingent contracts is infeasible and that formal contracting

is ineffective.
The tractable nature of models using the assumption of observable but nonverifiable information has made them an essential tool for evaluating trade-offs in
institutional design. However, despite its widespread influence, the assumption
that payoff-relevant information is observable but non-verifiable stands on controversial theoretical foundations. Building on work by Moore & Repullo (1988),
Maskin & Tirole (1999) show that if parties commonly observe payoff-relevant information, there often exists an auxiliary extensive-form mechanism that induces
truthful revelation of the relevant information in the unique subgame perfect
equilibrium of the game generated by the mechanism.
Maskin and Tirole’s critique of the microfoundations of incomplete contracting models that use the observable-but-non-verifiable information assumption is
troubling because it implies that the payoffs that are attainable with verifiable
variables are also attainable with variables that are only commonly observable.
Comparing the effectiveness of second-best institutional arrangements under incomplete contracts is moot when a mechanism exists that is capable of achieving
the same payoffs as the best contract with verifiable information. However, the
very limited use of implementation mechanisms leads to the question of whether
they can indeed costlessly reveal this information and overcome contracting problems via indirect verification.
In this paper, we experimentally explore the performance and adoption of an
SPI mechanism described in Maskin & Tirole (1999) that is designed to resolve
the hold-up problem in bilateral exchange with observable but non-verifiable ex
ante effort. In our experiment, a seller is selling a good to a buyer and may
provide costly effort to increase the value of the good. Effort and the value of
the good are commonly known to the trading parties, but they are not verifiable
by a third-party court. This implies that the two parties cannot write a contract
that conditions payments on effort or the value of the good and hence, any effort
made by the seller is prone to hold up.
While effort is not verifiable by a third-party court, public announcements can
be recorded and used in legal proceedings. Thus, the two parties can in principle
write a contract that specifies trade prices as an increasing function of the buyer’s
announcement of the good’s value. If the buyer always announces the true value of
the good, then his announcements can be used to set prices that promote efficient
effort. One way of doing this is to implement an arbitration mechanism that allows
announcements to be challenged by the seller and to punish the buyer any time
he is challenged. If the seller challenges only when the buyer has underreported
the good’s value, then the threat of punishment will ensure truth telling.
The crux of the implementation problem is to give the seller the incentive to
challenge only those buyer announcements that are below the value of the good. A
key property of the SPI mechanism is that it provides incentives for selfish buyers
to tell the truth and for selfish sellers to challenge only in the case that the buyer
lied. This is achieved by combining the seller’s challenge with an immediate fine
