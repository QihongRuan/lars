Abstract
Immigrants can expand labor supply and compete for jobs with native-born workers. But immigrants may also start new firms, expanding labor demand. This paper uses U.S. administrative
data and other data sources to study the role of immigrants in entrepreneurship. We ask how
often immigrants start companies, how many jobs these firms create, and how firms founded
by native-born individuals compare. A simple model provides a measurement framework for
addressing the dual roles of immigrants as founders and workers. The findings suggest that
immigrants act more as “job creators” than “job takers” and play outsized roles in U.S. highgrowth entrepreneurship.
