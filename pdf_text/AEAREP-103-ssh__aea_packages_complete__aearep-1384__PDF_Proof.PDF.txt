Abstract
Do natural disasters increase charitable giving or simply reallocate a fixed supply of
donations? We study this question using IRS data in the context of deadly tornadoes.
We find that, among ZIP Codes located in the same state but more than 20 miles
away from a tornado’s path, donations by households increase by about $2 million
per tornado fatality. We find no negative effects of tornado fatalities on donations to
charities located in these ZIP Codes. The results imply that giving in response to new
needs need not come at the expense of other causes.

1 Introduction
Charitable donations are an important source of funding for public goods and redistribution. Overall, U.S. charitable giving makes up about 2 percent of GDP (List, 2011). But
it is not well-understood whether an exogenous shock to human need, such as a natural disaster, increases total giving or simply displaces donations that would have gone to
other causes. Many laboratory experiments find that incentives or opportunities to donate to one charity reduces giving to the others.1 However, the laboratory setting may
not be reflective of typical giving. Outside of the laboratory, credible causal estimates of
displacement effects between causes are rare and generally encompass a small share of
charities or of total donations.
We estimate whether deadly tornadoes increase the total amount of charitable giving.
We measure charitable giving using an annual panel of ZIP-Code-level individual income
tax data from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), which report all income tax deductions
claimed for donations to any registered charity in 2002–2017. Only about 30 percent of
households itemize deductions, and itemized donations are disproportionately concentrated among high-income households (Internal Revenue Service, 2020). However, about
84 percent of donations by individuals are itemized, and giving by individuals comprised
about 70 percent of all giving in 2017 (Giving USA Foundation, 2018).
We combine the IRS data with geospatial information on the incidence of tornadoes.
We focus our attention on lethal tornadoes, which allows us to identify events that affected populated areas and caused tens of millions of dollars’ worth of damage, on average. Tornadoes offer a useful natural experiment because they vary over both space and
time but are generally limited in their geographic scope. Because tornadoes are shortlived and unpredictable, scientists have not been able to capture most tornadoes’ physical
properties, such as wind speed. Instead, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Admin1 See, for example, Reinstein (2012); Cairns and Slonim (2011); Reinstein (2011); Corazzini, Cotton and

Valbonesi (2015); Ek (2017); Filiz-Ozbay and Uler (2017); Deck and Murphy (2019); Harwell, Zindler and
Eckel. (2020); Schmitz (2019).

istration (NOAA) maintains a database capturing tornado-related fatalities, injuries, and
property damage—which are functions of both the tornado’s physical properties and the
characteristics of the area in which it touches down—of each reported tornado since 1950.
Our identifying assumption is that, conditional on a host of fixed effects and controls,
tornado fatalities are unrelated to any unobservable determinants of charitable giving.
We find that lethal tornadoes significantly increase total charitable donations by individuals living nearby but outside of the directly affected area. Specifically, a tornado
fatality increases total donations by individuals living at least 20 miles away from a tornado’s path but in the same state by about $2 million. Because total giving increases, we
can rule out perfect substitution between charitable causes and conclude that the supply
of donations is not fixed.
We then estimate fatal tornadoes’ effects on the receipts of charities using data from
information returns that charities file annually with the IRS. The charitable response to a
severe tornado typically involves providing victims with basic necessities such as food,
clothing, and shelter; tools for clean-up, such as gloves and shovels; and health services,
including for mental health.2 This work is done both by large organizations like the American Red Cross and by local organizations. We show that contributions received by charities within 20 miles of a tornado’s path increase by more than $1 million per fatality. We
also test whether there is a negative displacement effect on charities in locations more
than 20 miles away but in the same state—locations from which total giving increased.
Our estimate of the effect on donations to charities in these locations is positive and not
statistically significant, suggesting that donations to these charities do not decrease because of increased giving in response to fatal tornadoes.
Charitable giving for natural disasters is common, with a nationally representative
survey indicating that about 30 percent of U.S. households made such donations in each
of 2017 and 2018 (Bergdoll et al., 2019). Motivations for disaster giving vary, as demon2 See,

strated by two experimental papers studying giving to victims of Hurricane Katrina.
Eckel, Grossman and Milano (2007) find that facts about the aftermath and language
emphasizing a charity’s involvement in the relief effort has a positive effect in a distant
location (Minnesota) but a negative effect in a location closer to the hurricane (Texas).
Fong and Luttmer (2009) find that showing victims of subjects’ own race has a positive or
negative effect on giving depending on whether the subjects report feeling close to their
racial or ethnic group. Factors external to the donor many also influence the post-disaster
giving response: Brown and Minty (2008) find a correlation between media coverage and
internet giving for the devastating 2004 Asian tsunami.3 To our knowledge, our paper
is the first to quantify the charitable response to natural disasters using administrative
data.4 With these data we observe donations to the full spectrum of causes, allowing us
to estimate effects on total giving.
Our paper studies whether disaster giving displaces other giving. Nearly 80 percent
of U.S. households reported that their disaster giving did not affect their giving to other
causes (Bergdoll et al., 2019), but people may be reluctant to admit that they reduced
charitable giving to other causes. Consistent with the survey evidence and ours, however, Scharf, Smith and Wilhelm (2017) find that donors to international disasters do not
decrease their giving to other causes. Using time-series variation, they study donations
by individuals in the UK in the weeks following each of six appeals for major international disasters occurring between June 2009 and July 2014. By contrast, we are able to
define treatment and control groups in each year and estimate relative changes among
the treated.
The extent to which individuals substitute donations to one charity for donations to
3 A related literature focuses on the determinants of domestic or foreign disaster aid (e.g. Besley and

Burgess, 2002; Garrett and Sobel, 2003; Drury, Olson and Van Belle, 2005; Eisensee and Strömberg, 2007;
Strömberg, 2007; Healy and Malhotra, 2009; Cole, Healy and Werker, 2012; Deryugina and Kirwan, 2018).
4 Our use of individual income tax data follows the literature on the tax-price elasticity of charitable
giving (Randolph, 1995; Auten, Sieg and Clotfelter, 2002; Bakija, Gale and Slemrod, 2003; Bakija and Heim,
2011). Our use of the information returns that nonprofit organizations file with the government follows
studies estimating the effects of government grants on charities’ fundraising efforts (Andreoni and Payne,
2003, 2011).

another appears to vary across settings. In theory, increases in the number of charities or
in the number of people served by a charity have ambiguously signed effects on donations (Rose-Ackerman, 1982, 1987). The supply of donations may be completely fixed if
giving exhibits “mental accounting” (Tversky and Kahneman, 1981; Kahneman and Tversky, 1984; Thaler, 1985, 1999). Descriptively, the ratio of charitable donations to income
has been fairly constant over time (Andreoni and Payne, 2013) and across income categories (Meer and Priday, 2020). Field-study findings differ regarding whether intertemporal displacement does or does not occur (Meier, 2007; Landry et al., 2010; Bekkers,
2015)) and whether displacement between causes does or does not occur (Lacetera, Macis
and Slonim, 2012; Meer, 2017; Chatterjee et al., 2020; Petrova et al., 2020; Adena and
Hager, 2020). In a review of this literature, Gee and Meer (2019) conclude that “the evidence is decidedly mixed on whether the altruism budget is fixed or flexible.” Our paper
is the first to employ data that contain the majority of dollars donated across the U.S. and
the first to identify effects using a natural experiment with both geographic and temporal
variation.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we describe our data. In
Section 3 we lay out our empirical strategy for estimating the effects of tornado fatalities
on charitable giving. In Section 4 we report our results. We conclude in Section 5.

2 Data
2.1

Charitable donations to all causes

Annual data on charitable donations come from the IRS (IRS, 1998–2017). The data are
based on individual income tax returns, including all Forms 1040, 1040A, and 1040EZ.
They report deductions claimed for charitable donations in 2002 and in 2004–2017. We
also make use of the number of tax returns that include such deductions, the total number
of returns, and total Adjusted Gross Income (AGI). In real terms, charitable deductions
