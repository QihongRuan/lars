Abstract
Empirical researchers often combine multiple instrumental variables (IVs) for a single
treatment using two-stage least squares (2SLS). When treatment effects are heterogeneous, a common justification for including multiple IVs is that the 2SLS estimand
can be given a causal interpretation as a positively-weighted average of local average
treatment effects (LATEs). This justification requires the well-known monotonicity
condition. However, we show that with more than one instrument, this condition can
only be satisfied if choice behavior is effectively homogenous. Based on this finding,
we consider the use of multiple IVs under a weaker, partial monotonicity condition.
We characterize empirically verifiable sufficient and necessary conditions for the 2SLS
estimand to be a positively-weighted average of LATEs under partial monotonicity. We
apply these results to an empirical analysis of the returns to college with multiple instruments. We show that the standard monotonicity condition is at odds with the data.
Nevertheless, our empirical checks reveal that the 2SLS estimate retains a causal interpretation as a positively-weighted average of the effects of college attendance among
complier groups.

Introduction

Instrumental variables (IVs) are widely used to estimate causal relationships. In practice, researchers often combine multiple IVs using two-stage least squares (2SLS). In
Section 2, we report a survey of empirical papers using IV that were published in leading
journals since 2000. More than half of these papers report results from a specification
with multiple IVs for a single treatment, typically combined using 2SLS.
The textbook motivation for combining multiple IVs is statistical efficiency. However, this requires an assumption of constant treatment effects. In contrast, allowing
for heterogeneous treatment effects is a key motivation in the modern program evaluation literature, and one which is supported by a large body of empirical work.1 In an
influential paper, Imbens and Angrist (1994, “IA” hereafter) provided an alternative
justification for using 2SLS with multiple IVs, one which allows for heterogeneous treatment effects. They showed that the 2SLS estimand can be interpreted as a positivelyweighted average of local average treatment effects (LATEs) for subpopulations whose
treatment status is affected by the instruments. This result holds for any number of
instruments, as long as IA’s “monotonicity” condition is satisfied.2
The fact that widespread empirical practice rests on the monotonicity condition
raises a number of questions. What requirements does this condition place on choice
behavior when there are multiple IVs? Can we expect these requirements to be satisfied? If not, is it still possible to retain a causal interpretation of the 2SLS estimand
while allowing for unobserved heterogeneity in both treatment effects and choice behavior? The contribution of our paper is to answer these questions and, by doing so,
offer theoretical and empirical guidance for researchers who wish to use 2SLS with
multiple IVs.
In Section 3, we begin our theoretical analysis by showing that the monotonicity
condition cannot be satisfied with more than one instrument without restricting choice
behavior to be effectively homogenous.3 For example, if the treatment is college at1

Heckman (2001) compiled a list of empirical evidence on heterogeneous treatment effects prior to
2001. More recent papers that find evidence of unobserved heterogeneity in treatment effects include Bitler,
Gelbach, and Hoynes (2006), Doyle Jr. (2007), Moffitt (2008), Carneiro and Lee (2009), Firpo, Fortin,
and Lemieux (2009), Carneiro, Heckman, and Vytlacil (2011), Maestas, Mullen, and Strand (2013), Bitler,
Hoynes, and Domina (2014), Walters (2018), Felfe and Lalive (2018), French and Song (2014), Havnes and
Mogstad (2015), Kirkeboen, Leuven, and Mogstad (2016), Kline and Walters (2016), Carneiro, Lokshin, and
Umapathi (2016), Cornelissen, Dustmann, Raute, and Schönberg (forthcoming), Nybom (2017), and Brinch,
Mogstad, and Wiswall (2017).

In discussing the use of multiple IVs instead of a single binary instrument, Angrist and Pischke (2009, p.
173) write that “The econometric tool remains 2SLS and the interpretation remains fundamentally similar
to the basic LATE result, with a few bells and whistles.”

Our analysis here builds upon points made by Heckman and Vytlacil (2005, Section 6) and Heckman,
