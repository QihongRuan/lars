implementation of this research. Other UCLA clearances and approvals or other external agency or collaborating
institutional approvals may be required before study activities are initiated. Research undertaken in conjunction with
outside entities, such as drug or device companies, are typically contractual in nature and require an agreement between
the University and the entity.
General Conditions of Approval
As indicated in the PI Assurances as part of the IRB requirements for approval, the PI has ultimate responsibility for the

local laws regarding the protection of human subjects in research, including, but not limited to, the following:
Ensuring that the personnel performing the project are qualified, appropriately trained, and will adhere to the
