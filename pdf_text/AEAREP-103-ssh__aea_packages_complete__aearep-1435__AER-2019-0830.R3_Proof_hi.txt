How Research Affects Policy:
Experimental Evidence from 2,150 Brazilian Municipalities
By Jonas Hjort, Diana Moreira, Gautam Rao & Juan Francisco
Santini∗
Can research findings change political leaders’ beliefs and policies? We use experiments with 2,150 Brazilian municipalities to
measure mayors’ demand for and response to research information. In one experiment, we find that mayors are willing to pay
to learn the results of evaluation studies, and update their beliefs
when informed of the findings. They value larger-sample studies
more, while not distinguishing between studies in rich and poor
countries. In a second experiment, we find that informing mayors
about research on a simple and effective policy—taxpayer reminder
letters—increases the probability the policy is implemented by 10
percentage points.
Recent decades have seen an explosion of program evaluation research in economics.1 But how interested in and open to academic research are political
leaders? And, insofar as they “consume” research, can and do they act on new
findings? These are questions of fundamental importance for the science ecosystem. Despite the money and effort devoted to evaluating policy impact, we have
little understanding of whether the conditions necessary for the public to ultimately benefit hold: whether political leaders value such research; whether it
changes their beliefs about policy effectiveness; and whether leaders ultimately
implement policies that they otherwise would not have in response to new research findings. In short, is a lack of (access to) research information a binding
