We study targeted lockdowns in a multi-group SIR model where infection, hospitalization and fatality rates vary between groups—in particular between the “young”,
“the middle-aged” and the “old”. Our model enables a tractable quantitative analysis
of optimal policy. For baseline parameter values for the COVID-19 pandemic applied
to the US, we find that optimal policies differentially targeting risk/age groups significantly outperform optimal uniform policies and most of the gains can be realized
by having stricter lockdown policies on the oldest group. Intuitively, a strict and long
lockdown for the most vulnerable group both reduces infections and enables less strict
lockdowns for the lower-risk groups.
