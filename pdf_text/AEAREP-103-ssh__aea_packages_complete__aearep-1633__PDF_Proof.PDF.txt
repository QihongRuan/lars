Abstract

We examine U.S. children whose parents won the lottery to trace out the effect of financial
resources on college attendance. The analysis leverages federal tax and financial aid records and
substantial variation in win size and timing. While per-dollar effects are modest, the relationship
is weakly concave, with a high upper bound for amounts greatly exceeding college costs. Effects
are smaller among low-SES households, not sensitive to how early in adolescence the shock
occurs, and not moderated by financial aid crowd-out. The results imply that households derive
consumption value from college and household financial constraints alone do not inhibit
attendance.
