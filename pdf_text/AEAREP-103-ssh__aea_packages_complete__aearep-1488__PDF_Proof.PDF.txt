What to Expect from the Lower Bound on Interest Rates:
Evidence from Derivatives Prices
By Thomas M. Mertens and John C. Williams∗
This paper analyzes the effects of the lower bound for interest
rates on the distributions of inflation and interest rates. In a New
Keynesian model with a lower bound, two equilibria emerge: Policy
is mostly unconstrained in the “target equilibrium,” whereas policy is mostly constrained in the “liquidity trap equilibrium.” Using
options data on interest rates and inflation, we find forecast densities consistent with the target equilibrium and find no evidence
in favor of the liquidity trap equilibrium. The lower bound has a
sizable effect on the distribution of interest rates, but its impact
on inflation is relatively modest.
JEL: E52
Keywords: Lower bound, liquidity trap, forecast densities.
The lower bound on nominal interest rates has been the subject of extensive study in the
academic literature and a key factor in central bank practice over the past two decades.
Standard macroeconomic models predict that the lower bound can have profound effects
on the behavior of the economy and supply a set of testable empirical predictions. Yet,
introducing a lower bound into the New Keynesian model leads to multiple equilibria that
differ dramatically in the effectiveness of monetary policy. Therefore, empirical tests of the
prevailing equilibrium are critically important for assessing the effects and implications of
the lower bound. However, the relatively short period of time during which the lower bound
has been relevant limits the ability to quantitatively assess this issue using macroeconomic
data alone.
This paper makes two key contributions to the literature. First, it links the highermoment predictions of macroeconomic theory to prices of financial market derivatives related to options on interest rates and inflation. Second, it derives and tests hypotheses that
distinguish between multiple equilibria in an economy where interest rates are constrained
by a lower bound. It uses options data from U.S. financial markets to measure the effects
