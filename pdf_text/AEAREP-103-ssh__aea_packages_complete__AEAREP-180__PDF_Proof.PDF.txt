Accelerator or Brake? Cash for Clunkers, Household
Liquidity, and Aggregate Demand
By Daniel Green, Brian T. Melzer, Jonathan A. Parker and
Arcenis Rojas∗
This paper evaluates the Car Allowance Rebate System (CARS) by
comparing the vehicle purchases and disposals of households with
eligible “clunkers” to those of households with similar, but ineligible, vehicles. CARS caused roughly 500,000 purchases during the
program period. The provision of liquidity, through a rebate usable
as a down payment, was critical in generating this large response.
Participation was rare among households that owned clunkers with
outstanding loans, which required loan repayment. This decline in
participation is attributed to households’ preference for lower down
payments and distinguished from the effects of income, other indebtedness, and the program subsidy.

During the Great Recession, policymakers used a range of fiscal policies to
stimulate consumer demand, including temporary tax credits and price subsidies
on durable goods. Temporary incentives for the purchase of durable goods, like
temporary subsidies for capital investment by businesses, can in theory have large
effects by altering the timing of purchases. But the responses to such incentives
are often found to be quite low.1 A possible explanation is that intertemporal
