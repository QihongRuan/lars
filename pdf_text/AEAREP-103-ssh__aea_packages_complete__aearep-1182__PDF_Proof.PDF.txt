Knowledge Diffusion, Trade, and Innovation
across Countries and Sectors
By Jie Cai, Nan Li & Ana Maria Santacreu∗

This paper provides a unified framework for quantifying crosscountry and cross-sector interactions among trade, innovation,
and knowledge diffusion. This framework is used to study the effect of trade liberalization in an endogenous growth model with
comparative advantage and the stock of knowledge determined by
innovation and diffusion. The model is calibrated to match observed cross-country and cross-sector heterogeneity in production,
innovation and knowledge spillovers. The counterfactual analysis shows that a reduction in trade costs induces a re-allocation
of R&D and comparative advantage across sectors. Heterogeneous
knowledge diffusion amplifies specialization effects of trade-induced
R&D re-allocation, becoming an important source of welfare.

The world has increasingly become a highly interconnected network of countries
and sectors that exchange not only goods and services but also ideas. Much
is understood about how the benefits of trade may spread through production
input–output linkages, thanks to the growing literature on sectoral linkages.1 At
the same time, countries and sectors are linked in another way that has not
been studied nearly as much—innovation and knowledge spillovers, and how they
interact with trade to affect productivity and growth. Knowledge linkages across
countries and sectors are far from uniform (Acemoglu, Akcigit and Kerr, 2016;
Cai and Li, 2019). In a world with multiple sectors, trade affects the countries’
knowledge stock and composition, hence productivity. Productivity differences

induced by innovation and knowledge spillovers in turn condition the patterns of
trade and aggregate growth.2
This paper provides a unified framework to quantify the three-way interactions
among trade, innovation, and knowledge diffusion in a multi-sector environment
in which country-sectors are interconnected in both the product and knowledge
spaces. We build on existing models of trade with production linkages (e.g.,
Costinot, Donaldson and Komunjer, 2012; Caliendo and Parro, 2015). Our main
contribution is to add dynamics related to innovation and technology diffusion
across countries and sectors, thereby providing an endogenous mechanism for
cross-country-sector productivity differences.
Recent papers in the literature have modeled productivity dynamics through innovation (Buera and Oberfield, 2019; Perla, Tonetti and Waugh, 2015) or through
innovation and technology diffusion (Sampson, 2019). In contrast to these papers, we emphasize the role of heterogeneous intersectoral linkages which, as we
show in the paper, have important effects on income and welfare. In particular,
we find that heterogeneous knowledge spillovers, when interacting with crosscountry-sector differences in innovation efficiency, amplify significantly the gains
from trade in a way that the previous literature has not captured. We provide
empirical evidence for this heterogeneity and to study its role in determining innovation, production and trade patterns across countries and sectors in a unified
framework.
Our model consists of two “blocks”: A ‘trade block ’ that determines the static
equilibrium, taking as given country-sector productivity; and a ‘ growth block’
in which productivity evolves endogenously through innovation and knowledge
diffusion. The trade block builds upon the Ricardian model of trade with Bertrand
competition (Bernard et al., 2003). The growth block is modeled in the spirit of
Eaton and Kortum (1996, 1999), which analyze an endogenous growth model but
do not allow for trade or sectoral linkages.
Firms choose their research effort to create new ideas, while building on the current stock of knowledge. Ideas diffuse across all sectors and countries, although
the speed of diffusion is heterogeneous.3 In our model, knowledge diffusion increases the stock of knowledge in two ways. First, it increases the knowledge in
the receiving country-sector. Second, that increase in turn enhances the innovation efficiency there, fostering creation of more new knowledge. All diffused
ideas contribute to the stock of knowledge, but only the highest-quality ideas
2 A vast empirical literature has documented the significant impact of trade on innovation (e.g.,
Lileeva and Trefler, 2010; Bustos, 2011; Autor et al., 2016; Aghion et al., 2018). With regard to the reverse
relationship, Cameron, Proudman and Redding (2000) and Santacreu and Zhu (2018) find that innovation
and knowledge diffusion help determine trade patterns to the extent that they impact differences in
productivity.
3 In contrast with the literature on technology adoption, which assumes that only the best knowledge
is adopted following diffusion from the economies on the technology frontier (Comin and Hobijn, 2010;
Comin and Mestieri, 2018), our assumption is supported by observations that a nonnegligible number
of novel inventions are initiated by economies outside the frontier. However, similar to this paper, the
above studies also find that the rate at which technologies are diffused differs across countries and is
higher in richer countries.
